	<h2>Block Youtube Channels</h2>
	<p>
	  Frustrated by seeing videos from those annoying Youtube channels you hate, but can't do anything to hide them. You can flag them as 'Not Interested' but sooner or later they show up again.
	  This extension allows you to block certain channels on Youtube. The videos by these channels are hidden in your feed (and other locations) in Youtube. You can unblock them anytime you want and see all the channels you have blocked till now.
